#FA22_SP23 Branch

This branch maintains the files from the 2022-2023 tapeout season, where the first C2S2 Chip was designed and fabricated. The testing for the fabricated op-amp, as well as the files associated with the project, are placed into this branch (as these fioles may be used in the 2023-2024 season).
